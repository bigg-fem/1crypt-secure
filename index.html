 <p>at crypt secure we believe in bring the new age of digital hungry 
    entrepreurs to the new age of crypto currency and metaverse world This 
    text is a very boring text and I bet you will not manage to read the whole 
    text since the only period in the text is the one that ends the whole text that is by 
    the way so long and pointless that writing it is just as fun as the text becomes boring 
    since it is so long and pointless and also quite boring since it does not happen a single 
    thing the whole time it is going on which is very long so</p>
    <p>This year Fred and I have been working on articulating what Coinbase is all about.

        As organizations grow, it can be easy for people to start rowing in different directions, and doing too many things. We’re about 100 people now, which is still small, but even at our size we can’t communicate 1 on 1 with everyone on a regular basis. So we decided to craft a clear vision, mission, and strategy for the company.
        
        If you’re like me, these words sounded a bit silly the first time you heard them. They sound like “jargony stuff that big companies do”. However, if done right, they can help align everyone behind a common goal and attract the right people to the team.
        
        What is vision, mission, and strategy?
        To wrap my head around this I spoke with some other CEOs and executive coaches. There doesn’t seem to be any consistent definition of these terms in business. Everyone has their own flavor. So I tried to narrow them down to their simplest form.
        
        Now when I hear “vision, mission, and strategy”, I translate this into “why, what, and how”.</p>
